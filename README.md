# MM-Citalli-City
A map I made for the hit indie game Mini Metro

Take charge of the vast and enormous metro system of this futuristic technocratic metropolis. Can you unify the far ends of this bustling and lively polar capital of 55 million?
	...Or surrender control of one of the most largest Metros in this world's alternative future back to Citalli's Imperial govenment, an enormous technocratic governing body and one of the most powerful govenment's to ever exist in this alt-world's history?

This is Mini Metro's first map set in an alternative future, where a global technocratic superpower fron the polar fringes of the earth, rises up and changes the balence of powers thus changing the face of this world. FOREVER!

This is the first of the Citillan Alternative Future series of maps to come to Mini Metro. a world in the future, where a nation Known as Citalli, dominates global politics, and has changed the course of history.

Features and new things to come!!!
